# Local Binary Pattern and Re-identification

Using Local Binary Pattern, i compared mask results according to groundtruth results and calculate chi square distances for finding minimum distanaced mask result. This is summary of my scripts job.

I have data sets which provided by: http://www.votchallenge.net/vot2019/dataset.html

I have also groundtruth and Mask R-CNN results. But i share with you just for trial mask/gt values.
